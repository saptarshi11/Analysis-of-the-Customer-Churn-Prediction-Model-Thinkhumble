**Analysis of the Customer Churn Prediction Model**

**1. Data Generation and Preprocessing**
Synthetic Data Generation:

A dataset of 5000 customers was generated with attributes such as age, gender, contract type, monthly charges, tenure, etc.
Missing values were introduced in the TotalCharges and MonthlyCharges columns to simulate real-world data imperfections.
Feature Engineering:

New features were created, including TenureSquared, MonthlyChargesLog, TotalChargesLog, MonthlyChargesPerTenure, and TotalChargesPerTenure.
A target variable Churn was generated based on certain rules to introduce correlation with other features.
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
Numeric and categorical features were defined and transformed using pipelines for imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Churn Distribution:

The churn rate was found to be approximately 26.34%.
Visualizations showed the distribution of churn across different contract types, monthly charges, tenure, and other features.
Correlation Analysis:

A correlation heatmap was plotted to identify relationships between numeric features.
Key insights included higher churn rates for month-to-month contracts and customers with higher monthly charges.

**3. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**
Models Used:

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest, and XGBoost classifiers were trained using pipelines.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV.
Best Parameters:

The best hyperparameters for each model were identified and used to train the final models.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics:

Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Confusion matrices were plotted to visualize the performance of each model.
